# TPClustering
Pratical exercise on clustering made during my studies in Télécom ParisTech

For this exercise, I had to code the KMeans algorithm, as well as the Spectral Clustering algorithm, and compare them on a few toy datasets, so as to better understand their unique properties.

### The Notebook is in French!
Since this was part of my studies at Télécom ParisTech, all the comments were made in French, but hopefully the general progression of what is being done is not hindered too much by the language.
